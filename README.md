# spatial-geometry
This repository holds Python utilits for working with spatial geometry:
  1. Coordinates of a circumsphere and a circumradius for N-dimensional simplices
  2. Check for a point lying in an N-dimensional sphere.
  3. Computing alpha-shape (concave hull) for an N-dimensional set of points using algorithm from http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs268-11-spring/handouts/AlphaShapes/as_fisher.pdf (incoming)
